<H1>Instructions for processing MultiTimeLine workflow</H1>

This workflow follows on from the Site-Pipelines workflow. It produces a
time-series for the field site of both Landsat and Sentinel data, since the
beginning of 2013. The first part of the workflow is the same as the
Site-Pipelines workflow, so if Site-Pipelines has successfully completed, then
this workflow should require some minor* tweaking.<P>

Within the MultiTimeLine directory, there will be a template.ipynb file,
which can be used as a starting point. Copy this file and edit the first cell
as for the Site-Pipelines workflow. There are a few extra fields that need to
be filled in here:
<OL>
    <LI>Number 1</LI>
    <LI>Number 2</LI>

\* Easy, but laborious.
